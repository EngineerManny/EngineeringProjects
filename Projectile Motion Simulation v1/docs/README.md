# Projectile Motion Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the trajectory of a projectile launched at an angle with an initial velocity. It accounts for the force of gravity, g. The simulation calculates key parameters like the projectile's path, maximum height, and range.

## Features
- Simulation of projectile motion given an angle and initial velocity.
- Visualization of the trajectory in the x-y plane.
- Export of simulation data to a CSV file.
- Plotting of the trajectory and saving it as a PNG file.

### Derivation of Projectile Motion Equations
The equations of motion for the projectile were derived from first principles. The process included:

1. **Free Body Diagram**
2. **Newton's Second Law**
3. **Differntial Equations**
4. **Integration**

Here's the detailed derivation:

These equations describe the horizontal and vertical motion of a projecile under the influence of gravity, neglecting air resistance.
