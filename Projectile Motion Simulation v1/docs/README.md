# Projectile Motion Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates the trajectory of a projectile launched at an angle with an initial velocity. It accounts for the force of gravity, g. The simulation calculates key parameters like the projectile's path, maximum height, and range.

## Features
- Simulation of projectile motion given an angle and initial velocity.
- Visualization of the trajectory in the x-y plane.
- Export of simulation data to a CSV file.
- Plotting of the trajectory and saving it as a PNG file.
